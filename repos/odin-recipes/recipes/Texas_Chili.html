<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 ounces dried chile peppers (such as pastilla, guajillo, New Mexico chiles, and California chiles)</li>
    <li>4 cups hot water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finelyy chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (about 2 peppers)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>4 lbs boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 small chopped yellow onion</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons masa harina</li>
    <li>4 cups beef stock</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>sour cream for serving, to taste</li>
    <li>1 lime, cut into wedges for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1: Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Step 2: Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef</li>
    <li>Step 6: Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Step 7: Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Step 8: Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to avoid lumps. Add stock and remaining 1 1/4 cups water and stir to combine</li>
    <li>Step 9: Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer and cook, partially covered, 
        stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 2 hours. Stir in brown sugar and vinegar.</li>
    <li>Step 10: Remove from heat and let stand for 20 minutes before serving warm with sour cream and lime wedges.</li>
</ol>
